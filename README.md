👋 Hello and welcome!

I'm Sir. Wan Syah, a Pixel enthusiast from Malaysia 🇲🇾 with a growing interest in Android customization and modding — particularly for Pixel devices.

I'm currently learning and exploring how to enable advanced features like VoLTE, VoWiFi, and 5G on Pixel phones, especially for regions or carriers where these functions are not officially supported.

Through trial and error, I've started developing my own Magisk modules and experimenting with configurations such as build.prop, IMS, and APN settings.
While I'm still learning, I hope the small contributions I make can help others who are facing the same limitations on their devices.

Feel free to explore my work, share feedback, or collaborate. I'm always open to learning and improving along the way.
